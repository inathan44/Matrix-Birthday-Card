      "David,\n\nHappy Birthday! What an incredible year it has been for you! I want to take a moment to recognize just how impressive your journey has been—completing bootcamp in the Air Force is no small feat, and it speaks volumes about your strength, dedication, and commitment to excellence. You’ve proven that there’s no challenge too great for you to face, and I know you’re only just getting started.\n\nBeyond that, your drive to constantly better yourself, both in your career and in everything you do, is truly inspiring. You’re actively shaping your future with every step you take, and it’s exciting to think about where all your hard work will lead.\n\nWhile I congratulate you on all your feats thus far, I also wish to thank you for being such a great friend to Cio over the years. The bond you two share is something special, and because of that, I consider you a close friend as well. Anyone who is a true friend to my kin holds a special place in my heart, and I am grateful for the positive influence that you’ve had on his life—and on mine, too.\n\nThis year (and many others) is ripe with opportunity - and it's all yours for the taking! I have no doubt that you’ll continue to rise to every challenge. Keep pushing forward, keep dreaming big, and know that you have so many people who believe in you and are cheering you on.\n\nHere’s to an amazing year ahead, filled with even more success, growth, and all the happiness you deserve!",

      'David,\n\n\nSince Marce has already praised your accolades, character, and growth, I’m going to take my moment to leave you with a few bits of advice.\n\n\nExercise gratitude towards those around you, but especially towards yourself. Do this as much as you can, and as often as you can. You tend to downplay it, but the outpouring of support and the friend groups that you’ve become a core part of are a testament to who you are as a person. YOU worked to cultivate these relationships and bonds. YOU worked to be a pillar and anchor for your family and be an example. YOU deserve everything good that’s in your life currently, and all that is to come. Be grateful for the journey, the people who stood with you on the way, but most importantly, be grateful for you- the man who is pioneering the path.\n\n\nBe kind to yourself. You know more than most how easy it is to tumble into a void and trap yourself there. Don’t burden yourself by hyper-fixating on things that are not going right. Instead, celebrate them, and keep them as close reminders that you are a human being, not a machine. When you can catch a breath, take the deepest one you can. When you can crack a smile, grin until it hurts your cheeks. When something makes you laugh, cackle until your staff sarge kicks on your door to shut you up. Seek to enjoy and revel in all the positive moments and cherish them as fully as you can. Your kindness towards yourself will take you over obstacles, through challenges, and light the trail forward when everything seems bleak.\n\n\nLive in the moment. Be present. And don’t forget about the people who have had your back for 26 years! This journey you’re on will inevitably feel uncertain at times, and you may find yourself looking at the future and maybe even the past with some self-doubt and reservations. During those moments, ground yourself by remembering that we are cheering you on, ready to catch you whenever you falter. How incredible is it to have so many people in your life who are so proud of you, so supportive of you, and so happy to see you paving your way. Draw strength from knowing all those who are in your corner. You can do anything you set your mind to.\n\n\nI’m privileged over the past 7 years of our friendship to witness the trajectory that you took towards your life. I’m so happy to call you, my brother. Happy birthday.\n',
